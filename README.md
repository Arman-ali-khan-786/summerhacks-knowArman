About:
This is a basic portfolio template which I have designed for hackathon "Summer Hacks'21" organized by SOA Code Room. This portfolio website strictly follows the summer theme as mentioned in the website .

Inspiration:
I have designed this portfolio very carefully as it was instructed that i can choose only one theme out of many summer themes and each theme has 4 colours. So very carefully i have to choose our colorset so that our website will look simple and classy. This was my inspiration to design a portfolio website using a predefined colorset and this was our challenge too.

Installation Instructions:
No specific installation instructions

What you learned (languages and tech tools):
I have learned new things as how to use css properties and adjust them according to my html code and look further to improve it.

Challenges you faced:
There are two main challenges which I have faced during these 48 hours, one is making our website little responsive and another is adjusting the website layout using "CSS". Due to lack of experience of using css, my website layout was somehow disfigured. As we are beginners, everything was taking time as I are learning and developing simultaneously. At the end we are running out of time. 

Accomplishments you are proud of: 
Time managements, CSS , using Github tools specifically Github pages.

Future improvements:
 to become a full stack developer and create amazing websites , learns css and many more properties of it.
